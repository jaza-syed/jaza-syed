### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a Software Engineer and ML researcher interested in applications for creative industries, especially audio.

I'm also an occasional musician and live-coder, especially using [TidalCycles](https://tidalcycles.org/).

Some audio signal processing code I worked on at a previous role has been open-sourced here: https://github.com/emotechlab/griffin-lim
